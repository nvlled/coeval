Instead, I&#039;ve been working on a compiler using LLVM. Businesses, at least the kind seeking an entry level developer, don&#039;t really care about that. They want experience with Enterprise web frameworks.<br><br>Perhaps I&#039;m just lazy, or perhaps I&#039;m just using it as an avoidance technique. Every time I apply for jobs, I feel like a fraud or a failure. They all want 5-8 years experience with a dozen technologies and some of them I haven&#039;t even heard of before. At university I felt like a rockstar because I knew more than my classmates, but out in the real world, I feel overwhelmed and as though I might have chosen the wrong field. I&#039;ve never even contributed to an open source project. I&#039;ve only written projects I&#039;ve developed myself from scratch. The exception being a three month internship where I worked on an existing Spring MVC project for a small business.<br><br>Sometimes I wish I had been one of those outgoing social jocks in high school. I could have played football, been a big hero, have lots of friends, and then land a position in marketing. Maybe I would even have a wife and kids, live in the suburbs, and be a success. Instead, I&#039;m a very sub-par programmer and struggling not to be a complete failure. There&#039;s still hope though. If an employer takes a risk on me, I can learn more enterprise stuff, be mentored by knowledgeable people, and improve. Right now though, I&#039;m walking on a balance beam with failure beneath me and success on the other side. I hope I don&#039;t fall.","time":1412050746,"resto":44437536,"trip":"!!Dot69Lt2vXk"},{"no":44437925,"now":"09\/30\/14(Tue)00:20:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p44437536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44437536<\/a><br><a href=\"#p44437743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44437743<\/a><br>Yokoi a cute.<br><br>I&#039;m still working on my homework for C class.
